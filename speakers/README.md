# Speakers

The eight-channel speaker setup used to test the TAC5 coded is shown below.  Four off-the-shelf USB-powered [stereo speakers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DDK3W5D) mounted on an [articulated base](speaker_mount_x4.pdf) with [cable corrals](speaker_corral.stl) provide a compact setup which folds for portability.
